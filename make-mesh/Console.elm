A library for writing terminal-based scripts in elm.  The IO type
provides an interface for constructing "computations" that may perform
IO effects. Something with type `IO a` is a lazy computation that when
run will produce an `a`, possibly IO side effects. See Console.Runner for
how to run such a computation.
