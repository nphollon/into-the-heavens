    <h1>Projections</h1>
  
    <p>WebGL by default shows an orthographic projection.</p>

    <p>For first-person games, orthographic projections don't cut it. In an
    orthographic projection, things remain the same size as they move farther
    away from the camera. So for programs where a perspective view is needed, we
    use what cartographers call a gnomonic projection. The gnomonic projection
    is unique in that it preserves straight lines. This gives a view of the
    world that looks realistic, but unfortunately it is only useful for narrow
    fields of view.</p>

    <p>For fields of view larger than an octant, stereographic projections are
    much better than gnomonic projections. An entire hemisphere can be shown
    with bearable distortion. Unfortunately, straight lines in space no longer
    look straight to the camera.</p>

    <p>If you have a regular (gnomonic) projection matrix computed, you can
    easily use it to create a stereographic projection. Before multiplying the
    vertex position by the projection matrix, push the vertices away from the
    camera.</p>

    <p>position.z = position.z + length(position)</p>
